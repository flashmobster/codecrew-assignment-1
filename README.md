# Power Tools

Having the right tool can make a "hard" thing suddenly much more achievable. Set yourself up for success by getting the right tools and starting to learn them.

## Setup and Documentation

Follow the [Computer Setup Guide](https://curriculum-wlk2.onrender.com/CS_Curriculum/Module_1/Week%2000_HTML%20CSS%20GIT/Week%2000_HTML%20CSS%20GIT_Day%2001/Setup/) to prepare your development machine for serious coding.

This requires carefully following instructions, and potentially interpreting esoteric error messages. Practice those detail-oriented skills! Take things slowly, and if things go wrong, don't hesitate to get help.

## Requirements

By the time you've completed the guide, you should be able to run the following commands in your terminal and have each report a version number of what's installed.

- `code --version`
- `git --version`
